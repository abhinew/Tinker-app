# HomeRentingTinder

## Introduction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and it was a practice for making a React-Redux website.
It is inspired by the Tinder app to make a similar application for householders and renters.

### Login as renter
Basically, the renter looks for houses, check different images and decide if he likes, dislike or want to think more about the house.
- If he likes the house, then the houseold will notify as soon as he login to the system.
- If he wants to think, he can later check the house again.
- If he dislikes, the house will not show to him again.

### Login as householder
The householder can look at the profile of people who are interested in his house. He/She can decide if he/she likes or dislikes the renter.
- If he/she dislikes, the renter will be removed from his/her profile
- If he/she likes, then that is a match. He/She will receive the renter's phone/email to communicate.
